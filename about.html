    <div class="text">
		<p>I was born on 20th May 1996, in Dhankuta.When I was 5, we moved to Kathmandu. My childhood <br> was happy and sound, full of fun. I was so shy
	since I was child and still  I'm.I passed my school<br> level from Sunshine High School situated at Gurjudhara,Kathmadu and higher secoondary level<br> from
National Integrated College situated at Dillibazar,Kathmandu.And I am currently studying Computing Hons at Naya Aayam Multi-Disciplinary Institute.My father,Uttam Rai is an ex-army,<br> serving entire life for protection of the nation and my mother Amba Devi Rai is house-wife and<br> is motivation adn love of my life. Though, when I was child, I have no definite aim and goals,later<br> on I found myself so attached with technology. I began in touch with it and I eagerly wants to do<br> something in this field. I am so fascinated by the Hacker. So,I had set my goal to be professional <br> hacker. Within the time of 10 years, most of the bank, government offices, police department and <br> other organizations need the hand of good professional hackers to stop steal, exploit and sell<br> valuable data from black hat hackers(Black hat hackers are the hackers who hacked the system <br> for bad intention for their own personal profit). So, i will prepared myself and sharped my skills <br> so that i can stop black hat hackers and stop their bad intetion too. This is my dream, this is my <br> passion and I will not quit until I achieved what I desired. I will stand on my dreams. I want to<br> taste of success. A dream doesn't turn into the reality through magic: it needs passion, plans <br> determination and hard labour which i will do it from the bottom of my heart.</p>
